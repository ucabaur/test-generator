## Local webfonts not working for development

In development mode CSS sourcemaps require that styling is loaded by blob://,
resulting in browsers resolving font files relative to the main document.

A way to use local webfonts in development mode is to add an absolute
output.publicPath in webpack.dev.config.js, with protocol.

```javascript
// webpack.dev.config.js

output: {
  publicPath: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/',
  /* â€¦ */
},
```
